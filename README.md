# src-api-501-final
This is a project I wrote for a graduate level software development class. As of right now, the only things I have here are the things I designed for this project and no extra fetures. However, I may change this in the future by implementing more features, adding more thorough documentation, etc. Call it a speedrun.com game finder, the title I went with was mainly for the sake of the class.

## What is this?
This is a tool that returns a list of games/categories from speedrun.com filtered by your preferences. You can filter by run time (shorter vs. longer categories), the platform, and whether or not you need the game to allow emulation.

## How to use
pip install requests. Other than that, you should just be able to run main.py.

## Why does your readme/documentation suck?
Why are you asking?
